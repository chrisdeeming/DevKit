Xen Developer Tools
======

I am in the process of branching the excellent work by guiltar into a separate (new) add-on with some more features. I plan to integrate some of my existing add-ons into this, and some new tools I am hoping to build. I've long thought Guiltar's DevKit is absolutely invaluable for any developer. I now hope to make it even better and integrate some of my work into a single add-on.

Thank you guiltar :)

### Upgrading from guiltar's DevKit ###

Due to the rebranding and extra features in this product, and multiple changes to various files, the best course of action for upgrading from guiltar's wonderful DevKit add-on is as follows:

* Uninstall DevKit from the Admin CP
* Delete all files and directores in the library/DevKit directory
* Install Xen Developer Tools as a new add-on
