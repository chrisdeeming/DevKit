Xen Developer Tools for XenForo

I am in the process of branching the excellent work by guiltar into a separate (new) add-on with some more features. I plan to integrate some of my existing add-ons into this, and some new tools I am hoping to build. I've long thought Guiltar's DevKit is absolutely invaluable for any developer. I now hope to make it even better and integrate some of my work into a single add-on.


Thank you guiltar :)
